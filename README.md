# MM-DeepLab ðŸ§ âœ¨
### Custom Deep Learning Models from Scratch

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

**MM-DeepLab** is a personal deep learning framework where I build custom neural networks and optimization algorithms entirely **from scratch** in Python â€” without relying on high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.  

The goal is to deeply understand the fundamentals of deep learning by implementing everything manually: tensor operations, backpropagation, optimizers, activation functions, and training loops.

This project is both a **learning lab** and an **experimental playground** for AI algorithms.
